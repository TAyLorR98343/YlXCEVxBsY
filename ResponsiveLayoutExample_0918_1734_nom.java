 * The above class is a simple example of a JSF managed bean.
 * It contains a method that could be called by an action in the JSF view.
 * The method includes basic error handling and logging.
 * For a responsive layout, you would typically use CSS frameworks
 * like Bootstrap or Foundation, which are not included in this Java code.
 * Instead, you would reference these frameworks in your JSF XHTML pages.
